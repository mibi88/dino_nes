# Dino NES

A small NES game, heavily inspired by the chrome dino.

You can build it with `build.sh`
To build it and run it directly use `./build_and_run.sh`

It is made for PAL but it can also run on NTSC, your region gets detected on
reset.

# Possible improvements

* Set a minimal spacing between the cacti to make the game simpler and not
require pixel perfect jumps, that can be frustrating
* Remove flickering when loading nametables
* Don't hardcode sprites
* Add/improve some sound effects
* Add some music

There are surely a lot of other things that could be improved, but it's just a
simple game, I don't want to spend ages coding it.

# Special thanks

Special thanks to Gros Chien, Fiskbit, sylvie, johnybot, TakuikaNinja and other

etc.

# Dino NES

A small NES game, heavily inspired by the chrome dino.

You can build it with `build.sh`
To build it and run it directly use `./build_and_run.sh`

It is made for PAL but it can also run on NTSC, your region gets detected on
reset.

Big thanks to Gros Chien, Fiskbit, sylvie, johnybot, TakuikaNinja and other
people on the Nesdev Discord and forum for helping me to fix bugs, improve it,
etc.
